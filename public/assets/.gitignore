# See https://help.github.com/articles/ignoring-files for more about ignoring files.
#
# If you find yourself ignoring temporary files generated by your text editor
# or operating system, you probably want to add a global ignore instead:
#   git config --global core.excludesfile '~/.gitignore_global'

# When 'git push', gems are installed in 'vendor/bundle' by default
# ** https://stackoverflow.com/questions/12573596/

# Multiple '.gitignore' are available

# Ignore other unnecessary files.
